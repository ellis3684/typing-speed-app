    'A virtual assistant (typically abbreviated to VA) is generally self-employed \n'
    'and provides professional administrative, technical, \n'
    'or creative assistance to clients remotely from a home office.',

    'The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in \n'
    'which the typist keeps his or her eyes on the source copy at all times. \n'
    'Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists \n'
    'keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard \n'
    '(which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should \n'
    'sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat \n'
    'on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, \n'
    'and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward \n'
    'to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.',

    'Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts \n'
    'have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to \n'
    'mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the rise of the Internet \n'
    'has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated \n'
    '"language localization". Ideally, the translator must know both languages, as \n'
    'well as the subject that is to be translated.',

    'There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style "hunt and \n'
    'peck" and touch typing. For example, many "hunt and peck" typists have the keyboard \n'
    'layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some \n'
    'use just two fingers, while others use 3-6 fingers. Some use their fingers very \n'
    'consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, \n'
    'while others vary the way they use their fingers.',

    'Closed captions were created for deaf or hard of hearing individuals to assist in \n'
    'comprehension. They can also be used as a tool by those learning to read, learning \n'
    'to speak a non-native language, or in an environment where the audio is difficult to \n'
    'hear or is intentionally muted.'
