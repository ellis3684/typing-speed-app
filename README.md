# typing-speed-app

This is an app that checks your typing speed. There are several sample texts for you to copy, 
and once you have finished writing the given sample text, your typing speed will be shown to 
you in words per minute (WPM).

Functionality for this app includes: several sample texts (one of which will be shown to you at 
random); a spell checker that determines whether or not you copied the sample text successfully, 
and the ability to restart the test once finished.

This app uses [rdbende's Forest TTK Theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Forest-ttk-theme).

Enjoy!
